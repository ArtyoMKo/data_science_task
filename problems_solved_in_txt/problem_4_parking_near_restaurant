Problem: Is there an inconsistency in the following paragraph?: "A suburban located Starbucks makes on average $100,000
per month in revenue and has 10,500 square meters of an adjacent area dedicated to parking for visitors only. Despite
good revenue and overall satisfaction with service, both the staff and visitors are complaining that parking is full
more than half of the time."

Mu answer:
10500 m^2 can have 105x100 shape. One car have 15 m^2 (5x3 shape) + 15 m^2 (5x3 shape) as a road. It means 30 m^2 per car.
It means in one time in the parking can park 350 cars.
100000$ per month means 3300$ per month, 100$ per day. Because it is Starbucks, mainly people drink coffee by 3$ -> 33
people per day. With more "bad" conditions cap of coffee can have 2$, with 2$ coffee they could have 50 people daily,
which is too less. Lets compare, Starbucks have opportunity to have 300 cars in one time in the parking, even with 200 cars
it is too less.

Summary: it is super weird that with 100000$ income and with 10500 m^2 parking area they have a problem with parking.
